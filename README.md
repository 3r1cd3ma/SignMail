## About
- For put your images in the html code, use a PNG to Base 64 converter like [base64.guru](https://base64.guru/converter/encode/image/png)
- For created a marketing banner, you can use a graphic design platform like [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). I recommend a size of 600 x 150 px.

## About us

### What's the problem?

Email remains the most used communication tool in the professional world. Unfortunately, it is not easy to create a professional email signature and most of the professionals used a signature with just text or use an image. These methods do not allow to use the possibilities of email signatures and give a bad image of the company.

### The idea

Facilitate the creation of email signatures for professionals with a simple web interface where users only have to fill in their informations.  

## How does it work ?

1. The user fills in the information he wants to have on his signature and uploads the desired images
2. The template is displayed with the information entered
3. The user copies the template to their email client.

## Roadmap

See the [project board](https://github.com/3r1cd3ma/SignMail/projects) for the status and progress of the project.

## Getting started
